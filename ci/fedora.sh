# Note: Removed .x86_64 suffix from glibc-devel for aarch64 compatibility.
# Previously, it was included to ensure that the x86_64 version of glibc-devel
# was installed, particularly in cases where glibc-devel for i686 was present
# and would not trigger the x86_64 install. This situation is rare but could
# depend on specific user setups.
