This is the recipe for building the [DisplayLink driver][displaylink]
in a RPM package for Fedora, CentOS 7 and Rocky Linux. This driver supports the following
device families:

- DL-6xxx
- DL-5xxx
- DL-41xx
- DL-3xxx

The package includes the Open Source [evdi][evdi] library.

Packages get automatically built by GitHub Actions and get uploaded to
[GitHub releases][releases].

## Usage

> NOTE: Now buildable cleanly via .spec file (in mock f.e.). Download files
> via `make srpm`.

In order to create the driver rpm package you can run the command `make` from
within the checked out directory. The Makefile should download the files needed
for you and create an RPM.

A default `make` will use the evdi driver that is bundled with the Displaylink
driver package. If you need to use a newer released version from the evdi Github
repo and it is not currently present in the Displaylink driver package, you can
do so by running:

```bash
make github-release
```

### Secure boot on Fedora

To use displaylink-rpm and the evdi kernel module with secure boot enabled on
Fedora you need to sign the module with an enrolled Machine Owner Key (MOK).

First create a self signed MOK:

``` bash
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out \
MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=Displaylink/"
```

Then register the MOK with secure boot:

``` bash
sudo mokutil --import MOK.der
```

Then reboot your Fedora host and follow the instructions to enroll the key.

Now you can sign the evdi module. This must be done for every kernel upgrade:

``` bash
sudo modinfo -n evdi /lib/modules/5.10.19-200.fc33.x86_64/extra/evdi.ko.xz

sudo unxz $(modinfo -n evdi)

sudo /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv \
  ./MOK.der /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/evdi.ko

sudo xz -f /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/evdi.ko
```

Now any display, hdmi and/or dvi ports on your docking station should work,
and the displaylink.service should run.

## Hardware-specific behavior

---

### Dell D6000

When used with the Dell D6000 docking station, DisplayLink 5.1.26 regularly
loses communication with attached monitors, causing them to go blank and enter
power-saving mode.  At the time the monitors blank, the kernel logs two error
messages:

``` bash
kernel: usb <xxx>: Disable of device-initiated U1 failed.
kernel: usb <xxx>: Disable of device-initiated U2 failed.
```

To [work around this issue][workaround], disable power management for the audio
device by commenting out a line in `/etc/pulse/default.pa`:

``` bash
### Automatically suspend sinks/sources that become idle for too long
# load-module module-suspend-on-idle
```

## Development Builds

---

Generally we want to track the current stable release of the evdi library.
However, Fedora kernels are often much newer than those officially supported by
that release and it is not uncommon for a new kernel to completely break the
build. This can leave you in a situation where you cannot upgrade your kernel
without sacrificing your displaylink devices. This is not great if the new
kernel has important security or performance fixes.

The evdi developers use the `devel` branch as their main branch for all changes.

To pull the latest code from the `devel` branch and use it to build, do the
following:

``` bash
make devel

make github-release
```

Of course this `devel` branch will also include some experimental and less
tested changes that may break things in other unexpected ways. So you should
prefer the mainline build if it works, but if it breaks, you have the option of
making a `devel` build.

If you are using Fedora Rawhide, you can create a build which will automatically
download from the `devel` branch and build by running:

``` bash
make rawhide
```

> In the past, code in the `devel` branch would be tagged and that version is what
> would be included in the Displaylink driver package.
>
> Recently, we are seeing newer changes appear in the Displaylink driver package
> without the evdi library version being changed. This has created some confusion
> and difficulty when it comes to maintenance updates.
>
> The evdi folks have [acknowledged this issue][roadmap_discussion] and are
> working on making the process more transparent.

## Contributing

---

The easiest way to contribute with the package is to fork it and send
a pull request in GitHub.

There are two main kind of contributions: either a new upstream
version is released or a modification in the packaging is proposed.

There is a variable called `RELEASE` for packaging purposes. That
variable should be set to 1 when contributing a new upstream version
release, and incremented in one when adding any other functionality to
the specfile for the same upstream version.

### New Upstream release

From time to time, DisplayLink will update their driver. We try to do
so, but for that we usually rely on pull requests.

We manage three different upstream numbers for versioning:

1. evdi kernel driver version
2. DisplayLinkManager daemon and libraries version
3. Download ID number from DisplayLink (for automatic zip retrieval)

These variables need to be changed in the following places:

- Makefile
  - `DAEMON_VERSION` is the DisplayLinkManager version
  - `VERSION` is currently the evdi driver version
  - `DOWNLOAD_ID` is the `?download_id=` query parameter in
    DisplayLink website to download the zip

Also, please update the changelog at the bottom of the
displaylink.spec file.

### Packaging change

When changing a packaging rule, please increment the `RELEASE`
variable by one in displaylink.spec
